# 🏠 Wizard Houses API Wrapper

This project is a backend application using **Node.js + Express**. It integrates with **MongoDB Atlas** via **Mongoose** and uses **Axios** to fetch data from the external [Wizard World API](https://wizard-world-api.herokuapp.com/houses).

It returns data about magical houses and is ideal for developers who want to connect it to their own frontend.
